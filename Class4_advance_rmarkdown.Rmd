Here is inline text `r 2 + 2`

##task 4 Has a step-up chunk, with 3+ setting

```{r setup, include  = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
collapse = TRUE,
warning = FALSE,
message = FALSE,
echo = FALSE,
comment = "#>",
fig.path = "../figures/"
)

```

##task 5: Uses code from an external R script file and knitr::read_chunk()

The code chunk shows that we cannot easily show the code in the external script file using `source()`.

```{r RunCodeChunkNoEval, eval=FALSE} 
source('my-external-code.R')
``` 

The code chunk executes the externally located code using `source()`. When using this method, we cannot easily print the code. Text output is suppressed because we are using `results='hide'` and figures are plotted, but only after all of the code is executed. 

```{r RunCodeChunk, results='hide'} 
source('my-external-code.R')
``` 

The code chunk executes the externally located code using `source()`. When using this method, we cannot easily print the code. Text output is only for objects that we use `print()` on. And figures are plotted, but only after all of the code is executed. 

```{r RunCodeChunkShowAll, echo=FALSE} 
source('my-external-code.R')
```

This code chunk will pass the source code and fully print and evaluate all code in the external script

```{r code = readLines('my-external-code.R')}
```


```{r starwars-plot, fig.cap = "A ggplot of starwars stuf"}
library(tidyverse)
starwars %>% filter(species == "Human") %>% ggplot() + aes(x = height, y = mass) + geom_point()
```

We can see in figure \@ref(fig:starwars-plot)

```{r starwars-tbl}
starwars %>% filter(species == "Human") %>% select(name,height, mass, homeworld) %>% knitr::kable(caption = "A knitr kable table of starwars data")
```

We can see the figure in Table \@ref(tab:starwars-tbl)

``` {r my-fig, fig.cap = "My non-code figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("uw-w.jpg")
```

We can see the figure at \@ref(fig:my-fig)
