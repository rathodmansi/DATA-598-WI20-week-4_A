## Task 4 Has a step-up chunk, with 3+ setting

```{r setup, include  = FALSE}
library(tufte)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
collapse = TRUE,
warning = FALSE,
message = FALSE,
echo = FALSE,
comment = "#>",
fig.path = "../figures/"
)

```

## Task 5: Uses code from an external R script file and knitr::read_chunk()

The code chunk executes the externally located code using knitrr::read_chunk(). When using this method, we easily print the code. This code chunk will pass the source code and fully print and evaluate all code in the external script

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- data(starwars)
knitr::read_chunk("my-external-code.R")
```


This code chunk will pass the source code and fully print and evaluate all code in the external script

```{r code = readLines('my-external-code.R')}
```

## Task 1: Uses starwars dataset & tidyverse 
## Task 2: Has a plot and table with captions and cross-references

```{r starwars-plot, dependson= "load-data", fig.cap = "A ggplot of starwars stuf", cache = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
starwars %>% filter(species == "Human") %>% ggplot() + aes(x = height, y = mass) + geom_point()
```

We can see in figure \@ref(fig:starwars-plot)

```{r starwars-tbl, dependson= "load-data", cache =TRUE}
starwars %>% filter(species == "Human") %>% select(name,height, mass, homeworld) %>% knitr::kable(caption = "A knitr kable table of starwars data")
```

We can see the figure in Table \@ref(tab:starwars-tbl)

``` {r my-fig, fig.cap = "My non-code figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("uw-w.jpg")
```

We can see the figure at \@ref(fig:my-fig) 

## Task 3: Has two in-text citations using bibtex

The following is the citation of the research paper 'A developmental perspective on the role of motor skill competence in physical activity: An emergent relationship' by Stodden et al. [@stodden2008developmental].

[@stodden2008developmental] is an in-text citation of research paper written by Stodden and was published in 2008.
